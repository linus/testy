# ðŸ§ª Testy

Testy is no fuss [doctests][doctest] for Node.js. Document your code with
[JSDoc][jsdoc], provide your [@example][example], and run your tests with
[Mocha][mocha].

![CI status](https://github.com/linus/testy/workflows/ci/badge.svg)

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install @linus/testy
```

## Usage

1. In your code, document your functions with JSDoc tags, providing `@example`
tags for your examples:

```js
/**
 * A cool function
 * 
 * @param {string} name
 * @returns {string} A greeting
 * @example hello("Mr von Neumann")
 * //=> "Hello, Mr von Neumann!"
 */
 export function hello(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
 }
```

**Notes**: The function under test **must** be exported, and it **cannot** be a
default export. Only named exports work. The expected result **must** be
prefixed with the string `//=>` on the beginning of a new line, after the
example code.

2. To execute the test, add a file which is discovered by Mocha (e.g. in a
`tests/` directory), and call `testy` with the path to the file to be tested:

```js
import { testy } from "@linus/testy";

/**
 * A test
 */
describe("Tests", () => testy("hello.js"));
```

3. Run `mocha` and relax. Your code *and* your examples are tested!

```bash
$ npm test

  Tests
    hello.js
      hello
        âœ” hello("Mr von Neumann")
//=> "Hello, Mr von Neumann!"


  1 passing (6ms)
```

## Advanced

Testy can handle Promises (in both examples and expected results), expected
Errors (both thrown Errors and rejected Promises), generator functions, and
more. Examples are in [test/spec](test/spec). This also acts as the
specification and test suite for Testy.

## Development

Testy is under active development. Pull requests are welcome:

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the project to your own machine
3. Commit changes to a new branch of your fork
4. Push your work (making sure the code is tested!)
5. Submit a pull request
